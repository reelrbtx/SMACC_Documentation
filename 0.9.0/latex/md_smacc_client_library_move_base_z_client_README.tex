\subsection*{Description}

The Move\+BaseZ client extends the R\+OS navigation stack in a high level way. It provides specialized navigation planners (for the R\+OS Navigation Stack) that navigate only using pure spinning motions and straight motions. Implements some mechanism to perform motions recording the path and undoing them later. These can be very useful in some industrial applications where the knowledge or certainty on the environment is higher (ros planners are focused on cluttered and dynamic environments).
