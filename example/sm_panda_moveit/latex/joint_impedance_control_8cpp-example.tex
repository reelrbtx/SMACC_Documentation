\hypertarget{joint_impedance_control_8cpp-example}{}\section{joint\+\_\+impedance\+\_\+control.\+cpp}
An example showing a joint impedance type control that executes a Cartesian motion in the shape of a circle. The example illustrates how to use the internal inverse kinematics to map a Cartesian trajectory to joint space. The joint space target is tracked by an impedance control that additionally compensates coriolis terms using the libfranka model library. This example also serves to compare commanded vs. measured torques. The results are printed from a separate thread to avoid blocking print functions in the real-\/time loop.
