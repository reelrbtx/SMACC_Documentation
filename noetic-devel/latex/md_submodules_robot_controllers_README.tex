This is a robot control infrastructure, developed initially for Fetch and Freight, but designed to be robot-\/agnostic. In comparison to ros\+\_\+control, \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacerobot__controllers}{robot\+\_\+controllers}} offers the ability to \char`\"{}stack\char`\"{} controllers and avoids template-\/based hardware interfaces. \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacerobot__controllers}{robot\+\_\+controllers}} has not be designed with real-\/time constraints in mind, and is intended primarily for robots where the real-\/time joint-\/level controllers are run in hardware, as is the case for Fetch and Freight.
