The robot\+\_\+controllers\+\_\+interface package provides R\+OS messages and header files that define how robot controllers are created and managed. There are several key components\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A Controller\+Manager, which manages the loading, starting and stopping of controllers.
\item One or more Controllers, which actually convert R\+OS messages into commands to the mechanism.
\item One or more Handles, which expose an A\+PI so that Controllers can pass commands to the mechanism.
